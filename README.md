Hi, I'm Bhargav Modak! (that's pronounced Mo - 🦆 for ya! )

## My interests

📖 → 💻 I'm enthusiastic about finding better tools that improve learning environments, as well as improve the efficiency of workflow. I also want to create tools that help students and office workers to better manage their time.

🎮 I also do love playing games, and talking about them, meeting communities, which led me to have experience in moderating and owning discord servers. I also do love creating guides and tools for games that enhance the new user experience.
